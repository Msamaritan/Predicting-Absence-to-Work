# Predicting-Absence-to-Work
Thanks to Machine learning, we can now predict the absence to work with the help of the datasets and the magic of ML in it!

## WORKFLOW
  - We collected all the necessary datas for the prediction and saved it in Absenteeism_data.csv file.
  - Then we preprocess the data with some really nice methods.
  - And all the feature description are given in a image file, incase if get confused about the dataset.
  - Finally, we create the model and now we can predict the absence to work of particular person.
