# Predicting-Absence-to-Work
Thanks to Machine learning, we can now predict the absence to work with the help of the datasets and the magic of ML in it!

## WORKFLOW
  - We collected all the necessary datas for the prediction and saved it in Absenteeism_data.csv file.
  - Then we preprocess the data with some really nice methods.
  - We exported the preprocessed data to Absenteeism_Preprocessed.csv file
  - And with the help of preprocessed data and minor processing to it we obtained our input and target data that we want to train our model.
  - As the output are binary we use Logistic Regression model for this prediction.
  - Finally, we deployed the model and now we can predict the absence to work of particular person.
